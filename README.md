# shinyChecklist

Getting to know the RStudio addins and created a Checklist that can be used
within RStudio. 
Might be helpful for some, who don't want to "leave"" Rstudio to manage their 
checklist and then get distracted doing something else.

Note:
The tools saves the checklist as an RDS file in your working directory.


## Installation

You can install shinyChecklist from github with:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("shinyChecklist/Persedes")
```

Following this shinyChecklist is available as a Rstudio addin.
Bind it to a keyboard shortcut for faster acess!
